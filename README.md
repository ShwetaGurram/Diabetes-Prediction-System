# ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction System
Project Overview

The Diabetes Prediction System is a machine-learning-based web application built with Flask that predicts whether a person is Healthy, Pre-Diabetic, or Diabetic based on their lifestyle and medical data.
It uses a dataset containing health indicators such as age, gender, BMI, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level.

The goal of this project is to assist in early diabetes risk detection and increase awareness about lifestyle-related health conditions.
